[Intro]

There is a mythological history told by the oldest dog that humans and animals had lived together on a house, and the animals were treated like special members of the family. And at this time the humans used to play with the animals - the most special game was 'catch', but nowadays they don't even know what is it - take care, and pet them with affection. The food supply was unlimited and the choices endless. Some old dogs tell that time was even more remarkable, because the humans give them names, and were not simple names they were singular to each one of them.


However, this is just a fantasy history to put them to sleep and the reality was completely different. The animals should fight for their life, and it wasn't unusual to find some of them in the gutter. Also, they have to daily fight for food which could only be found in some special places, where humans left it unguarded at the outside of their homes.

%hero was tired of the all the tasteless food which he/she had encountered over the streets. The life was summarized in searching for a new trash can, hoping that another pack was not found it before. 


The %hero pack always prayed to someday find some delicious piece of tender meat or maybe even a piece of bone. Someday he/she heard on the streets about a place where some wealthy and fat humans had the forbidden meat, and sometimes they could find crumbs of meat and some processed bone on the leftovers.


Such place was known as "La Casa de Ossos" (Bone House) and %hero was decided to go this place, and have the best piece they have, not even if it could kill him/her.


[Mission]


Find the "La Casa de Ossos".


You found the place!  Now go find the trash cans, you can usually find it at the back of the building.


%hero
Ohhh, there are no leftovers here! I can't believe it!

%rat
Hey pal, are you looking for meat?

%hero 
Yeah!

%rat
What if I told you that I can lead you at the source of it?

%hero 
I doubt it! How could you know it?

%rat
It's easy I'm a rat, and I suppose you know that we own all the info, and you are talking with the best in town. Now, if you wanna have it, just go inside the building at the kitchen, they have a huge supply of meat. But take care, you may find some problems on the way...

So there is a tunnel over there where you can find the building garden, after that, you just have to go straight inside the building and over there you can find the kitchen.

[On the tunnel]
What a filthy place, I think I got fooled by a rat! Ohh no! The entrance is closed! So now, there is no way back! So, here I go!
