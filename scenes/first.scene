        -: There is a mythological history told by the oldest dog that humans and animals had lived together on a house, and the animals were treated like special members of the family. And at this time the humans used to play with the animals - the most special game was 'catch', but nowadays they don't even know what is it - take care, and pet them with affection. The food supply was unlimited and the choices endless. Some old dogs tell that time was even more remarkable, because the humans give them names, and were not simple names they were singular to each one of them.
        -: However, this is just a fantasy history to put them to sleep and the reality was completely different. The animals should fight for their life, and it wasn't unusual to find some of them in the gutter. Also, they have to daily fight for food which could only be found in some special places, where humans left it unguarded at the outside of their homes.
        -: $hero was tired of the all the tasteless food which she had encountered over the streets. The life was summarized in searching for a new trash can, hoping that another pack was not found it before.
        -: The $hero pack always prayed to someday find some delicious piece of tender meat or maybe even a piece of bone. Someday $hero heard on the streets about a place where some wealthy and fat humans had the forbidden meat, and sometimes they could find crumbs of meat and some processed bone on the leftovers.
        -: Such place was known as "La Casa de Ossos" (Bone House) and $hero was decided to go this place, and have the best piece they have, not even if it could kill him.
